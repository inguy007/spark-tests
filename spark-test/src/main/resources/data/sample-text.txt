Word2Vec is an Estimator which takes sequences of words representing documents and trains a Word2VecModel. The model maps each word to a unique fixed-size vector. The Word2VecModel transforms each document into a vector using the average of all words in the document; this vector can then be used as features for prediction, document similarity calculations, etc. Please refer to the MLlib user guide on Word2Vec for more details.Word2Vec computes distributed vector representation of words. The main advantage of the distributed representations is that similar words are close in the vector space, which makes generalization to novel patterns easier and model estimation more robust. Distributed vector representation is showed to be useful in many natural language processing applications such as named entity recognition, disambiguation, parsing, tagging and machine translation.
